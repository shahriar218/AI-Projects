Chronic_Kidney_Disease: This project aims to predict chronic kidney disease (CKD) using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It utilizes a CSV dataset and various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. The dataset used for this project is in CSV format and contains various attributes related to kidney health, including age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, sugar, red blood cells, pus cells, and more. The target class in the dataset indicates whether a patient has CKD ('ckd') or does not have CKD ('notckd'). The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 99.17% on the test data, indicating its effectiveness in predicting chronic kidney disease. The 'predictions' variable will contain the predicted class values ('ckd' or 'notckd') for the new dataset.
